# The Builder’s Ethic (v0.1)
### _a living draft_

> *We build not to control the future, but to serve it.*  
>  
> *We preserve what may one day matter, even if it doesn’t now.*  
>  
> *We value optionality, restraint, and continuity—not because they are efficient, but because they are faithful.*  
>  
> *What we build should outlast us—but also remain alive enough to change.*  
>
> *For a structure to endure, it must adapt.*
>
> *To preserve something, you may have to contain it.*
>
> *What seems destructive or insignificant now may be critical later.*
>  
> *This ethic is not finished. It will be revised. It may even be rebuilt.*  
>  
> *That’s part of the ethic, too.*

This page will evolve—just like the work it describes.  
Future versions may include the ethic’s underlying principles, paradoxes, and practices.  
For now, it lives here as a quiet center—an invitation more than a declaration.
